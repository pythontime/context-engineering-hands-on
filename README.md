# Context Engineering Hands-On

**O'Reilly Live Training** — Teaching developers how to design, manage, and optimize the context that flows into LLMs and agentic systems.

Five sessions across ~4.5 hours: slides, live demos, and hands-on code — all runnable with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and an Anthropic API key.

---

## Course Structure

| Session | Topic | Demo |
|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | Introduction to Context Engineering | Claude Code live demo scripts |
| 2 | Engineering Context in Agentic Systems | Hand-rolled agent loop with TF-IDF retrieval |
| 2 / 4 | Context Engineering in Modern AI Apps | FastAPI chat app with structured artifact output |
| 3 | Diagnosing and Fixing Context Failures | Jupyter notebook — four failure modes |
| 5 | Tools and Techniques for Modern Development | *(coming soon)* |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — the package manager used by every demo
- **Anthropic API key** — get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Set your API key

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Add it to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to persist it across sessions. Alternatively, create a `.env` file in any demo directory:

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > demos/<demo-name>/.env
```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd context-engineering-hands-on
```

No global `pip install` or virtual environment needed — every demo uses `uv run` to manage its own dependencies inline.

## Demos

### Session 1 — Claude Code Live Demos

**Directory:** `demos/ctx-engineering-principles-claude-code/`

This is a **live instructor demo** — no Python script to run. Follow the guide in your terminal using Claude Code.

**Files:**
- `live-demo-guide.md` — Step-by-step demo script (5 demos, ~30 min)
- `context-window-guide.md` — Supporting reference: context window mechanics
- `long-doc-middle.txt` / `long-doc-top.txt` — Documents used in the "Lost in the Middle" demo

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify it works
claude -p "hello"
```

**Running the demo:**

Open `live-demo-guide.md` and follow the instructions. Each demo section tells you exactly what to type in the Claude Code terminal, what to expect, and what to highlight for the audience.

**What's demonstrated:**
- Demo 1: What's already in the context window before you type anything
- Demo 2: Context rot — how accumulated irrelevant context degrades output quality
- Demo 3: Lost in the Middle — how information position affects retrieval
- Demo 4: Grounding vs. memory — why `Read <file>` beats parametric recall
- Demo 5: All 7 Playbook rules in rapid succession

### Session 2 — Agentic Document Retrieval

**Directory:** `demos/agentic-retrieval/`

A hand-rolled agent loop with explicit context management and TF-IDF document retrieval. Every context engineering decision is visible — no framework magic.

**Run:**

```bash
cd demos/agentic-retrieval
uv run app.py
```

**Suggested query sequence** (follow this order to watch context grow):

1. `What documents do you have?` — triggers `list_documents`
2. `What is context engineering?` — triggers `search_documents`
3. `Tell me more about the Manus architecture` — triggers `get_document` for full content
4. `How does RAG relate to what Manus does?` — multi-doc synthesis
5. `/context` — inspect the raw messages array
6. `/stats` — see cumulative token counts
7. `Summarize everything we've discussed` — large input context, high cost
8. `/clear` — reset and compare fresh vs. accumulated cost

**Slash commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context` | Inspect the raw messages array |
| `/stats` | Show cumulative token statistics |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation and token counts |
| `/docs` | List knowledge base documents |
| `/help` | Show help |
| `/quit` | Exit |

### Session 2 / 4 — Chat with Artifacts

**Directory:** `demos/chat-with-artifacts/`

A FastAPI backend + single-file frontend demonstrating a 3-layer system prompt, structured tool output, and a growing artifact registry injected into context.

**Run:**

```bash
cd demos/chat-with-artifacts
uv run app.py
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** in your browser.

**What to try:**
- Ask about any topic to see the artifact system in action
- Watch the token counter grow in the stats bar as artifacts are created
- Ask to be quizzed to see context from earlier turns referenced in new outputs

**What's demonstrated:**
- 3-layer system prompt (persona + artifact schemas + dynamic session state)
- Structured output via a single `create_artifact` tool
- Dynamic context injection — the artifact registry grows and re-enters the system prompt
- Conversation history as accumulating context

**Bonus — minimal structured-outputs primer:** `structured_outputs_demo.py` in the same directory is a standalone ~30-second read showing the same prompt forced through 3 different tool schemas (no FastAPI scaffolding). Run with `uv run structured_outputs_demo.py`.

### Session 3 — Context Failures Notebook

**Directory:** `demos/context-failures/`

A Jupyter notebook walking through all four LLM context failure modes: Poisoning, Distraction, Confusion, and Clash. Each section runs a **broken** version, then a **fixed** version, and compares token costs side by side.

#### Kernel Setup (required before first run)

The notebook uses `anthropic` and `IPython.display` — you need a Jupyter kernel that has these installed.

**Option A — Install into an existing kernel (quickest):**

```bash
cd demos/context-failures
pip install anthropic ipython jupyter
```

If you already have Jupyter installed system-wide, this is enough. Open the notebook and select your default kernel.

**Option B — Dedicated uv environment (recommended for isolation):**

```bash
cd demos/context-failures

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install anthropic ipython jupyter ipykernel

# Register it as a named Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name context-failures --display-name "Context Failures (uv)"
```

Then launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook context_failures.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab
```

When the notebook opens, select **"Context Failures (uv)"** from the kernel picker (top-right or Kernel menu).

**Option C — VS Code / Cursor:**

Open `context_failures.ipynb` in VS Code/Cursor. When prompted to select a kernel, choose the `.venv` interpreter at `demos/context-failures/.venv/bin/python`. VS Code will detect it automatically if you created the venv inside the demo directory.

#### API Key Setup

The notebook reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment. Set it before launching Jupyter:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
jupyter notebook context_failures.ipynb
```

Or create a `.env` file in the demo directory — the notebook's setup cell will pick it up if you add a `load_dotenv()` call, or just export it in the shell that launches Jupyter.

**Verify the key is visible:**

```python
# Run this in a notebook cell to confirm
import os
print(os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "NOT SET"))
```

#### Running the Notebook

Run cells **top to bottom** — the `results` dict accumulates outputs used in the final dashboard. Don't skip the setup cell (Section 0).

**What's covered:**

| Section | Failure Mode | What Goes Wrong | Fix Applied |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Poisoning | Hallucinated assistant message overrides system prompt | Context pruning + validation instruction |
| 2 | Distraction | Prior brute-force examples bias model away from DP solution | Context quarantine + summarization |
| 3 | Confusion | 12 irrelevant tool schemas overwhelm a simple factual question | Tool loadout (remove unused tools) |
| 4 | Clash | Budget and luxury travel plans coexist, producing incoherent output | Pruning + state replacement |
| 5 | Dashboard | Side-by-side token comparison for all four failures | — |

Each failure cell is self-contained — you can run them independently if you only want to demonstrate one.

### Session 5 — Tools and Techniques *(coming soon)*

**Directory:** `demos/ctx-engineering-tools-claude-code/`

This demo is a placeholder for Session 5 content on advanced context engineering tools and patterns for production systems.

## Troubleshooting

**`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not found**

```bash
# Check if it's set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Set it for the current session
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**`uv: command not found`**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Then restart your terminal
```

**Jupyter kernel not finding the API key**

Jupyter inherits environment variables from the shell that launched it. Always `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` *before* running `jupyter notebook`, not after.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anthropic'` in the notebook**

Your selected kernel doesn't have the package installed. Either install it into the active kernel (`pip install anthropic`) or switch to the kernel you created with `ipykernel install` (see Option B above).

**Port 8000 already in use (chat-with-artifacts)**

```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
# Then re-run
uv run app.py
```
